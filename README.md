# mysql-data-tables
Using the mysql connector with python to extract and print a data table.

This program uses the mysql python connector.

To use this program, you need to change the password in `pass.txt` to whatever your password is. Then change the username in the code to whatever your username is.
Change variable names to whatever is appropriate and done.

I have coded an alagorithm to print out each column and list item so it lines up with the last.
